- [x] CS161, this class is to introduce the computer security.
- [x] MIT s6.031, this class is to introduce the software construction.
- [x] MIT 6.5940, this class is to introduce the efficient deep learning.
- [x] MIT Missing semester, this class is to introduce the tools that will never be taught in class but will be very useful.
- [x] Dive into deep learning, this class is to introduce the deep learning and machine learning.
- [x] deeplearning-ai, this class is to introduce the deep learning and machine learning.

## The project I have done and to be done

- [x] Relation extraction with BERT
- [x] Name entity recognition with BERT
- [x] The object kinetic Monte Carlo simulation
- [x] The program of canonical Huffman compression
