# my-CS-road

Here is the document of my self-study road to Computer Science.
Hope to help you with the endless time.

## The open source classes I have taken and to be taken

- [x] [CS61c](https://github.com/wplf/cs61c-2020summer), this class is to introduce the computer system.
- [x] [CS161](https://github.com/wplf/cs161-sp24), this class is to introduce the computer security.
  - The project 1, which is about exploiting the C program vulnerabilities using gdb.
  - The project 2, which is about the encrypted system using Go. It is really a heavy project, and I haved started it.
- [x] [MIT 6.5940](https://github.com/wplf/MIT_6.5940), this class is to introduce the efficient deep learning.
- [x] [CMU 10-714](https://github.com/wplf/CMU-Deep-Learning-Systems), Deep learning system. The class will lead to build your own dlsys needle (NEcessary Element of Deep LEarning system). 
  - Needle supports training and inference with CUDA backend, cpu backend and numpy backend.  
- [x] Dive into deep learning, this class is to introduce the deep learning and machine learning.
- [x] deeplearning-ai, this class is to introduce the deep learning and machine learning.
- [x] MIT s6.031, this class is to introduce the software construction.
- [x] MIT Missing semester, this class is to introduce the tools that will never be taught in class but will be very useful.
- [ ] [CS 839 Advanced Machine Learning Systems, Spring 2022](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shivaram/cs839-sp22/)
  - This course will cover a wide range of topics related to the design and implementation of Systems for Machine Learning including efficient model training, inference and specialized systems designed for graph learning, recommendation systems etc.
  - The prerequisites for this course are Advanced Operating Systems (CS 736) or Big Data Systems (CS 744), or equivalent courses.
  - This is really a high performance ML-sys, and I just find it recently. 



## The project I have done and to be done

- [x] Relation extraction with BERT
- [x] Name entity recognition with BERT
- [x] The object kinetic Monte Carlo simulation
- [x] The program of canonical Huffman compression
- [ ] Tinyflow, which is to implement the deep learning framework, written by tianqi.
      [UPDATE], this class is covered in CMU 10-714. I will put tinyflow aside. 

## Other millstones about CS

- [x] LeetCode knight
- [ ] LeetCode guardian.
